  "website name": {
    question: `
    What does sua mean? Why does your username and website have so many of them?
    `,
    answer: `
    sữa means milk in vietnamese. Maybe I could shorten it to sua5 or s5.
    `,
  },
  "website content": {
    question: `
    Where is everything? How come the website is so basic?
    `,
    answer: `
    I'm not a web developer by trade, so this is me branching out into another
    field of software engineering. I agree, it's not the flashiest website, but
    that's fine. The biggest learning experience for me has been acting as the
    project manager, creative director, primary software engineer, and devops
    engineer.

    Just look at the GitHub issues, pull requests, and deployments! I am
    learning about how to make free and open source (FOSS) projects by
    painstakingly documenting each and every commit and design choice. Maybe one
    day, someone will find my website useful or this will help me land a new job
    (unlikely lol). TLDR; The web design will get better! Just stick around!

  "text editor": {
    question: `
    What's your favorite text editor?
    `,
    answer: `
    neovim and tmux duo goes undefeated. If I am in a pinch or some git diff
    looks too confusing, I'll use Visual Studio Code (goated don't get me
    wrong).

  },
  "favorite language": {
    question: `
    What's your favorite programming language?
      `,
    answer: `
    Python by a long shot. No other languages come close to the time-value
    proposition that it offers.
    `,
  },
  "computer science?": {
    question: `
    Should I study Computer Science?
    `,
    answer: `
    Take my answer with a grain of salt because I entered the job market at a
    very favorable time. I still do think that Computer Science (not software
    engineering, note the distinction) is still a worthwhile skill and
    ultimately a very intellectually rewarding career path.

    Take the leap, and brace for the dive.

  "why mac?": {
    question: `
    Why are you using macOS? Isn't it overpriced and worse than Windows and
    Linux?
    `,
    answer: `
    I firmly believe in my heart that macOS is the best operating system and
    that MacBooks are the best value proposition between battery life, screen
    quality, portability, compute capability, usability, and aesthetics. Sure,
    there aren't as many ports on it, but you can always buy a dongle (lol). I
    won't lie, it is expensive, but it is not overpriced by any means.

    About the comparison to Windows and Linux, my answer is that it depends on
    what you want to do. If you're not a developer or creative, then you will be
    fine with a Windows machine. If you're a gamer, then macOS and Linux
    probably isn't for you (keep an eye out on Asahi for macOS and Proton for
    Linux). I would advocate that we learn all the major operating systems and
    get out of this stupid culture war -- just use what works for you!

  "why not linux?": {
    question: `
    Follow up question, why not Linux?
    `,
    answer: `
    I do use Linux at home (NixOS btw) and at work daily, but Linux is not
    anywhere close to the level of convenience and power that macOS and MacBooks
    offer. The harmony between the hardware and software take Macs to the next
    level. In my opinion, there isn't much more that Linux offers that macOS
    doesn't offer to a casual or low-to-mid tech enthusiast.

    Most of the time, your device that you put Linux onto will not work out of
    the box. You will have to do mind-boggling configuration for trackpads,
    audio, webcams, thunderbolt connections, etc. If you want to get into the
    rabbit hole of figuring out the hardware quirks and dotfile configuration, I
    encourage you to go ahead!

    Personally, I've realized that it's a big waste of time. Over the Summer I
    tried my hand at building the perfect Sway (tiling window manager) setup,
    but it was exhausting and frankly neverending. I was chasing a minimal setup
    to tell people that I had a minimal setup, not to actually work! Today, I'm
    fine with plain Gnome or KDE for the desktop experience because I'm trying
    to get things done.

  "latest obsession": {
    question: `
    What's something that you've been obsessed with?
      `,
    answer: `
    Running, but I've been slacking lately tbh. I'm still undoing years of
    gamer-rotting in my bedroom playing League of Legends, so mile by mile is
    difficult and strenuous still. We're making slow progress since May 2024
    though!

  "favorite food": {
    question: `
    What's your favorite food?
      `,
    answer: `
    Easy. My mom's phở has the most unique and flavorfull broth I've ever
    tasted. No other phở has come close, whether it be family, friends, or
    restaurants -- (my real answer is spicy chicken deluxe combo from
    chick-fil-a).

    question: `
    What's your favorite drink?

    I've been loving this maple black tea that my girlfriend bought me when she
    visited Canada earlier in the year.

  "favorite game": {
    question: `
    What's your favorite video game?
    `,
    answer: `
    Hearthstone is the only game that I still play consistently. I still keep up
    with League of Legends but only through loltyler1's YouTube and Twitch. I've
    played lots of Elden Ring over Summer 2024, but I'm taking a break for my
    sanity.
