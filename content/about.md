# About

Hi! My name is Justin Hoang. I am a graduate from Colorado School of Mines. I
have a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science with a focus on general Computer
Science, though I did take a few artificial intelligence and machine learning
classes.

This is my personal website where I'll talk about whatever I learned about or
think is interesting. I imagine that the blog posts will be anything from
software engineering, fitness, school, history, philosophy, and more. I'll also
have cool projects that I've been working on, my résumé, tech stack, and more.
