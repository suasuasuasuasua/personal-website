# About

Hi! My name is Justin Hoang. I am a graduate from Colorado School of Mines in
Golden, Colorado. I earned a B.S. (2023) and M.S. (2025) in Computer Science
with no particular focus area. I graduated Summa Cum Laude for my undergraduate
degree and picked up a cybersecurity certificate from Mines along the way.

This is my personal website where I'll talk about whatever I learned or am
learning about or think is interesting. I imagine that the blog posts will be
anything from software engineering, fitness, school, history, philosophy, and
more. I'll also have cool projects that I've been working on, my résumé, tech
stack, and more.

I am currently a software engineer in the defense industry, which is not quite
where I imagined I would be at this point in life. I always thought I would end
up at a company like Google or Apple as a software engineer when I graduated.
Nevertheless, I'm grateful for this experience because I've learned so much
along the way about aerospace and electrical engineering and project management,
which are things I never would have learned in school or in the tech world.
