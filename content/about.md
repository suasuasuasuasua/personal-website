Hi, I'm Justin Hoang. I have been working as a software engineer since 2023. I
have since graduated with two degrees in Computer Science and have been working
full-time for about 2.5 years. This website is a space for me to write about
what I'm learning about, probably tech-focused, and my thoughts in general.

## Experience

- Software Engineer @ [Lockheed Martin
  Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html) (April
  2024 Present)
- Software Engineer Asc @ [Lockheed Martin
  Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html) (July
  2023 April 2024)

My primary programming languages are C++ and Python. I have used C++ extensively
for developing high performance simulation software. Moreover, I am familiar
with using Python for data analysis and validation. Recently, I have stepped
into a role that oversees high-level software architectural design over a
multi-container setup. Other skills I have are managing AWS EC2 instances and
project management.
