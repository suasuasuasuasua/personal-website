[^1]:
    The Chromebook is running Fedora Linux GNOME, not NixOS, for stability
    reasons. Fedora has more out-of-the-box support [according to the official
    Chrultrabook
    docs](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/installing/installing-linux.html).

    My girlfriend needs the MacBook more than me nowadays, so I daily drive
    the Chromebook
