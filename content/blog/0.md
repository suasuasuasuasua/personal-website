The blog is finally set up, and it's thanks to VSCode's AI agent mode. The agent
mode has been super helpful getting me to this point, but I'll do the heavy
lifting from here. I love that I can make a request in a chat window, the agent
scans my directory structure and just _does everything_ in the background while
I'm anticipating the next problem. I've been procrastinating setting up the blog
because I had no idea how to start, and this [blog
scaffolding](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-portfolio) from
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) wasn't being very helpful when I asked a
[question](https://github.com/vercel/examples/issues/967).

Using AI agents does feels like sort of a cheat, I'll admit. But to be fair, I'm
not a web developer anyway, and this is more of a hobby or a 4fun project. On
the other hand, if I did want to get into web development, I should seriously
learn everything that I'm writing. I do feel like I can understand why the AI
agent does certain things but it would take me a lot longer to figure it out
(and a lot of googling!). Moreover, this website could have been a lot easier
since I'm just making a static website. I could have just used something easier
like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or plain `html` or `md` files, but I'm extra
and wanted to learn `typescript` and Next.js so I feel like a real software
engineer (lol).

I wrote pretty much everything else on the website though, but I appreciate
having a second glance at the codebase, especially because I'm a noob with
TypeScript and don't have anyone else to consult. I'm sure this website is
_really bad_ if a real web developer came across it, but it's fine.

So far, I've gotten help with the following things:

- Refactoring codebase into `src/` folder
  - Previously folders like `components/`, `styles/`, and `types/` were located
    on the top level which made the code feel cluttered yet scattered
  - I had to explicitly tell the AI agent to use the new `@app` router structure
    for modern `Next.js`
    - Refactoring redundant item lists (and other code) from the various pages
  - I keep forgetting that the core principle behind and power of `React` is the
    modularity and reusability of components
- Refactoring `app/` folder into logical groups using parenthesis syntax `()`
- Setting up the blog
  - Uses [`mdx`](https://mdxjs.com) for the blog posts (basically markdown plus
    react) which is A) easy to write and B) maintains consistent formatting
  - Slug generation
    - Use the metadata variable from each posts
  - Chronological Pagination (newest first), showing five posts at a time
    - on the `/` (index) route -- limited to the three latest posts
    - on the `/blog` route
  - Table of contents generation
  - Time-to-read estimation
    - Assumes a reasonable 200 words read per minute
- Setting up the portfolio
  - Links to and pulls information from my resume GitHub repository
  - Grouped by month and year
  - Ability to download each resume
  - Drop down under each release

TLDR; I still don't really know what I'm doing with this website, so I'll use
the AI to point me in the right direction.
