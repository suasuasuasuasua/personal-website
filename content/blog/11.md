## Life is What You Make It

Life is hard. Getting up early for work is hard. Preparing lunch and making
dinner every night is hard. Going grocery shopping every weekend at Walmart and
Costco is hard. Eating healthy is hard. Finding time for passions like art and
music is hard. Commuting sucks. Paying rent sucks. Going to the gym when you're
already tired sucks.

I could sleep in, call in sick, and work from home. I could dine outside or
order food delivery. I could buy all the junk food I want. I could put off
learning instruments because "I should focus on work or school" or "I don't have
enough time". I could skip the gym because "it's leg day, and I need a rest day
anyway." I could ignore the calls and text messages from friends and family
because I'm "too busy."

While there are many aspects of life that you cannot control, I realize that
life begins when you understand what you _can_ control. It's simple, yet it
requires a profound shift in perspective. The easy way is _easy_ for a reason,
but I have found that the things in life that are the most worthwhile and
meaningful are difficult.
