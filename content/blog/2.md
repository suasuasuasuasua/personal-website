I am going to be looking at the repo at [this point in
time](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/personal-website/tree/c40e1abe6a76de1c11a43f0b870a9186cc33145a)
(called a hash).

## `devenv.nix`

I use [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/) to define per-project development shells.
The packages come from [`nixpkgs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). Since
`devenv` uses `nix` and `nixpkgs` under the hood, you get two important
benefits: 1) a reproducible build with the lockfile (`devenv.lock`) and 2) an
elegant way to define all dependencies in a unified interface.

You might be thinking, "doesn't `package-lock.json`" do that for you already?
Yes, but only for the project dependencies. This does nothing for external
tooling and programs. Is this overkill for a personal website? Maybe. But it
scratches the OCD in my brain.

In the `devenv.nix`, you'll find declarations for packages, languages,
git-hooks, and more. As an aside, `devenv` has a long list of features like
processes, services, and containers that I haven't even scratched the surface
of.

```nix
# devenv.nix
#
# nix is a domain specific language (DSL) and has a
# json-like structure
{
  # https://devenv.sh/packages/
  packages = with pkgs; [
    git
    pre-commit
    treefmt
    # ...
  ];

  # https://devenv.sh/languages/
  languages.javascript = {
    enable = true;
    pnpm = {
      enable = true;
      install.enable = true;
    };
  };

  # https://devenv.sh/git-hooks/
  git-hooks.hooks = {
    treefmt.enable = true;
  };
}
```

This is something that _I_ added and was not in the template repository. I do
think that it's worth mentioning because it's so cool (and because I'm such a
fan for it). I would use a pure
[`flake.nix`](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) `devShell`, but I've found
that it can be tricky and you'll often spend more time debugging the flake file
than actually doing useful work. Maybe that's just a skill issue.

## `package.json`

The `package.json` file specifies the properties of the package like the name,
version, dependencies, website links, and more. It's pretty straight forward and
standard file for any web-based project with `javascript` or `typescript`.

## `treefmt.toml`

[`treefmt`](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt) is another program that I've
recently fell in love with. The idea is that `treefmt` unifies the interface for
all your formatters. This is especially useful in a multi-programming language
project like a web app.

For my website, I'll admit that this isn't super helpful since I use `prettier`
for most of the files. Again, this is something that I personally added to the
repository and was not present in the template.

## `.devcontainer.json`

This file is used to spin up a `devcontainer`, which is another layer of
dependency isolation and reproducibility. The base image also uses `nix` and
reads from the `devenv.nix` and `devenv.lock` files, so I thought that was
funny. It's like a double condom of safety.

`devcontainers` are super easy to do [in
VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). I've been
trying to get [`remote-nvim`](https://github.com/amitds1997/remote-nvim.nvim) to
work, but it's been finicky because I'm using
[`nixvim`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) on NixOS and nix-darwin
machines (probably).

## `.editorconfig`

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a file that defines a set of
standards regardless of which text editor or IDE you are using. This is a
project that I recently learned about and think is super neat.

[Some editors](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed) recognize EditorConfig
and work out of the box. [Other editors](https://editorconfig.org/#download)
require you to download a plugin.

## `.envrc`

The `.envrc` tells [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) what to load when you enter
the project directory. My `.envrc` loads up the [`devenv` shell](#devenv).
Moreover, `direnv` is going to watch the `devenv.nix` file for any changes and
rebuild the shell. Super useful.

```text
# .envrc
use devenv
```

If this feels sus, that's fine. You don't have to use `direnv`, and if you are,
you can just disable it in the directory with `direnv block`.

## `.eleventy.config.js`

I think this is the most important file of the website. In here, we setup 11ty
just how we need it according to the [specs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/).
From what I understand, we add many plugins for the blog, setup pre-processors
for drafts, copy folders (like `public/`) around, add watch targets, templating
files, and more.

## `_config/`

There is a single file here called `filters.js`. From what I can tell, this file
is used to define helper filter functions for the blog posts. Inside of
`eleventy.config.js`, we import and add that file (the exported function) as a
plugin.

According to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/), plugins are "custom
code that Eleventy can import into a project from an external repository."
That's really cool! So that means that we can extend Eleventy in tons of
different ways, and there is support for doing that locally or from someone
else's code online. I'll definitely have to spend time researching the plugin
ecosystem to see what is out there.

At the top of `eleventy.config.js`, there's a block of imports from `@11ty`,
which are a bunch of different plugins that make the blog _a blog_. I won't dive
into what each plugin does right now, but I'll do more research along the way.

## `_data/`

This folder is _global_ data that is exposed to every template in the [11ty
project](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/). This means we can ensure
consistency across all the web-pages without horribly hardcoding everything and
inevitably messing something up.

There are two files in this folder: `eleventyDataScheme.js` and `metadata.js`.
I'm not one hundred percent sure about the first file, but it seems to do
something with validating whether a post is draft content or not. The second
file defines some metadata about the website and author. This file was easy to
fill in, and I'm guessing that I can add literally whatever else property I want
to track about myself or the website.

## `_includes/`

This is a folder with template files for rendering the `html` pages. This blog
starter pack uses `nunjucks` (`.njk`). The language is a bit _archaic_ in my
opinion, but the idea is that it's a combination of `html` and some `njk` logic
that helps you generate web-pages.

For example, we have one file called `postslist.njk` which lists all the blog
[posts](https://www.blog.sua.sh/blog). There are another three files under `layouts/`
called `base.njk`, `home.njk`, `post.njk` which are pretty self explanatory.

The `nunjucks` files themselves somewhat read like `html`, but they also have
special _logic_ for iterating over collections, getting time, accessing
attributes, etc.

## `content/`

The `content/` directory is where I will be primarily working, particularly
under `blog/` when I write posts. This directory has more `.njk` files that
define pages like [tags](https://www.blog.sua.sh/tags/), the
[index](https://www.blog.sua.sh/index.html), and more. This directory seems like a
step up above the `_includes` folder with higher level logic and organization.
You can either write `md` files with the `js` preamble to identify the page; or,
if you need additional `nunjucks` logic, you can do that instead.

### `blog/`

This is where all my blog posts live. I am currently writing them in markdown
(`.md`) for simplicity. They will be organized by date in year, month, and day
order. Currently, the slug contains the entire filename which I don't like. I
would like to enumerate the posts so I can easily count how many I have and
allow for easier navigation. Also, I want something like the tags page but for
the year, month, and date respectively.

Again, not sure how easy this is to achieve, but it would be a nice stretch goal
and quality of life improvement as I write more and more posts.

#### `drafts/`

I will be putting my drafts under this folder as I am writing them. I just
learned that all I have to do is add `draft: true` to the preamble block so that
the pre-processor can skip this file. It will still be compiled in development,
but not during a build.

### `feed/`

The feed folder has data for an `rss` feed to my blog posts. You can use
something like [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) to subscribe.

## `css/`

The CSS folder is pretty straightforward. It controls the styling of the
website. I probably won't be messing around with this too much in the beginning
stages, so my website will look rather plain.

## `public/`

The public folder will contain images and other assets in use throughout the
website. Currently, there is nothing there, but I have left a `.gitkeep` as a
placeholder until I do.

---

Overall, the blog template isn't too difficult to understand. Everything feels
very logical and intuitive. The biggest challenge for me right now is just
figuring out the `11ty` ecosystem and idiomatic ways to do things.
