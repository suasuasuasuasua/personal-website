I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! Bills are being paid, and savings are being
saved. I figure that's a good sign that we're doing well.

This post summarizes my experience as a baby adult. I want to aggregate thoughts
and lessons that have been on my mind. I hope one day that I'll revisit these
posts with a fresh and interesting perspective.

## Logistics

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Gas
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance(s)
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Travel savings

Don't even forget that you have to schedule and remember _all_ your appointments
like oil changes, dental or health appointments, and events and holidays with
friends and family.

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.

## Life is What You Make It

Life is hard. Getting up early for work is hard. Preparing lunch and making
dinner every night is hard. Going grocery shopping every weekend at Walmart and
Costco is hard. Eating healthy is hard. Finding time for passions like art and
music is hard. Commuting sucks. Paying rent sucks. Going to the gym when you're
already tired sucks.

I could sleep in, call in sick, and work from home. I could dine outside or
order food delivery. I could buy all the junk food I want. I could put off
learning instruments because "I should focus on work or school" or "I don't have
enough time". I could skip the gym because "it's leg day, and I need a rest day
anyway." I could ignore the calls and text messages from friends and family
because I'm "too busy."

While there are many aspects of life that you cannot control, I realize that
life begins when you understand what you _can_ control. It's simple, yet it
requires a profound shift in perspective. The easy way is _easy_ for a reason,
but I have found that the things in life that are the most worthwhile and
meaningful are difficult.
