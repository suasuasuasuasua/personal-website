I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! Bills are being paid, and savings are being
saved. I figure that's a good sign that we're doing well.

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Gas
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance(s)
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Travel savings

Don't even forget that you have to schedule and remember _all_ your appointments
like oil changes, dental or health appointments, and events and holidays with
friends and family.

Don't even get me started on the daily chores like:

1. Washing and drying the dishes
1. Doing the laundry
1. Washing and changing the bedsheets every week
1. Taking out the trash
1. Cleaning up the living room, bedroom, and bathroom
1. Commuting to and from work
1. ACTUALLY WORKING
1. Cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner
1. Working out
1. Drinking and eating enough
1. Shopping for groceries

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.
