I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! Bills are being paid, and savings are being
saved. I figure that's a good sign that we're doing well.

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Gas
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance(s)
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Travel savings

At the same time, you need to think about how much money you want to put towards
any of these savings. With the retirement, is it going to be 10%? 10% after tax?
10% before tax? What about investing in the Roth IRA? Should you split it? For
your individual stocks, should you be investing in the AI bubble now? Or just
playing it safe with the S&P500? How much money should you be putting towards a
house? How much of your paycheck should be going towards rent? Are we even going
to be able to afford houses at this point, even on an engineer salary? I should
probably be living with my parents now to be saving money.

Starting now, we need to be figuring out and filing taxes. At this point, I just
wanna put it all on red.

Don't even get me started on the daily chores like:

1. Washing and drying the dishes
1. Doing the laundry
1. Washing and changing the bedsheets every week
1. Taking out the trash
1. Cleaning up the living room, bedroom, and bathroom
1. Commuting to and from work
1. ACTUALLY WORKING
1. Cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner
1. Working out
1. Drinking and eating enough
1. Shopping for groceries

Don't forget that you have to schedule and remember _all_ your appointments
like oil changes, dental or health appointments, and events and holidays with
friends and family.

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.
