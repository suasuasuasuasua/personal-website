I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! Bills are being paid, and savings are being
saved. I figure that's a good sign that we're doing well.

This post summarizes my experience as a baby adult. I want to aggregate thoughts
and lessons that have been on my mind. I hope one day that I'll revisit these
posts with a fresh and interesting perspective.

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Gas
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance(s)
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Travel savings

Don't even forget that you have to schedule and remember _all_ your appointments
like oil changes, dental or health appointments, and events and holidays with
friends and family.

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.
