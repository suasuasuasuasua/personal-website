I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! I figure that's a good sign that we're doing
well.

This post summarizes my experience as a baby adult. I want to aggregate thoughts
that have been on my mind. Some of these sections deserve their own post to be
completely honest. I hope one day that I'll revisit these posts with a fresh
and interesting perspective.

## Logistics

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Travel savings

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.

## Productivity is the Killer of Joy

This is probably the number one struggle I've had my whole life, especially
throughout my Bachelor's degree and while I was full-time employed and studying
for my Master's degree.

## Change is Good

It is never too late to be the person that you want to be.

## Memories are Reconstructions

In one of the chapters in The Handmaid's Tale, the main character is
reminiscing.

> “This is a reconstruction. All of it is a reconstruction. It's a
> reconstruction now, in my head, as I lie flat on my single bed rehearsing what
> I should or shouldn't have said, what I should or shouldn't have done, how I
> should have played it. If I ever get out of here Let's stop there. I intend to
> get out.”

I think about this quote often when I start to ruminate on my past. I think
about how my the thoughts that I'm thinking about aren't the exact thought that
I thought (huh?). It's like taking a measurement with a scale. Is my weight
145lb? Or 145.01lb? Or 144.99lb? The measurement that I get is only as accurate
as the measurement device, and even then there is uncertainty.

And so, when I think about my past (or the future), my brain is taking a
measurement of my experience, which my experience itself is a measurement of
existing in the world. It is not possible to perfectly reconstruct feelings,
thoughts, and experiences. We can only attempt to put those pieces together. We
want go to a place that doesn't exist, in a time we can no longer come back to.
Memory is a fickle thing, and reconstruction is the best we can do.

Sometimes I think about the circumstances that pushed me out of my parents
house. Was it really that miserable? I think hard about it, and it couldn't have
been that bad right? I missed my parents and brother for the first two weeks. I
wasn't alone because i had my girlfriend, but I felt lonely. It was like I lost
them even though they were only half an hour away. Rather, it was like I lost
that piece of my life -- like that chapter in my life is inextricably closed
forever.

I've been back to my parent's house. I don't quite feel like a stranger, but I
also don't feel like I belong. I stand in my room and think about the _me_ that
used to inhabit this place. The _me_ that spent the last 20 or so years growing
up in this place. The _me_ that was so unhappy in the dysfunction of that house
that I _had_ to leave. I also think about the _me_ that was dying laughing with
my brother playing video games. I think about the tender moments with my mom and
dad. I think about my 18th birthday and high school graduation celebration when
all my friends and family came over. And most of all, I think about my parents
growing older. I feel bitter because, even though I think I'm grown up, I still
feel like a petulant child who's feelings got hurt and will hold a grudge until
it's too late.

Home brings out a certain softness in me. But at the same time, it hardens my
heart because I know I made the right decision to move forward and to choose
myself.

## Life is What You Make It

Life is hard. Getting up early for work is hard. Making dinner every night is
hard. Going grocery shopping every weekend at Walmart and Costco is hard.
Finding time for passions like art and music is hard.

Commuting sucks. Paying rent sucks. Going to the gym when you're already tired
sucks.

I could sleep in, call in sick, and work from home. I could order dine outside
or order food delivery. I can put off learning the guitar because "I should
focus on work" or "I don't have enough time". I could skip the gym because "it's
leg day and I need a rest day anyway."

> didn't plan out the meals correctly this week.

## What's Next?

Anyway, I'm still figuring things out, and I hope that I never stop learning and
striving to be better each day.
