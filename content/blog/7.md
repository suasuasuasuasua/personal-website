I moved out of my parents house about 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend of two
years. We're both still alive! I figure that's a good sign that we're doing
well.

This post summarizes my experience as a baby adult. I want to aggregate thoughts
that have been on my mind. Some of these sections deserve their own post to be
completely honest. I hope one day that I'll revisit these posts with a fresh
and interesting perspective.

## Logistics

First of all, let's start with the logistical side of being an adult. You have
to pay for **everything**.

1. Emergencies
1. Food
1. Girlfriend Tax
1. Insurance
1. Internet
1. Rent
1. Utilities

And at the same time, I need to think about investing in these:

1. 401k
1. Emergency savings
1. HYSA (savings account)
1. Individual brokerage account
1. Roth IRA
1. Traveling savings

Thinking about it all makes me dizzy :face_with_spiral_eyes:.

## Productivity is the Killer of Joy

This is probably the number one struggle I've had my whole life, especially
throughout my Bachelor's degree and while I was full-time employed and studying
for my Master's degree.

## Change is Good

It is never too late to be the person that you want to be.

## Memories Are Precious

In one of the chapters in The Handmaid's Tale, the main character reminisces
about the fickle nature of memory.

> get out”

I think about this quote often when I start to ruminate on my past. I think
about how my the thoughts that I'm thinking about aren't the exact thought that
I thought (huh?). It's like taking a measurement with a scale. Is my weight
145lb? Or 145.01lb? Or 144.99lb? The measurement that I get is only as accurate
as the measurement device, and even then there is a uncertainty.

And so, when I think about my past (or the future), my brain is taking a
measurement of a measurement of my experience. It is not possible to reconstruct
feelings, thoughts, and experiences. We can only attempt to put those pieces
together.

Sometimes I think about the circumstances that pushed me out of my parents
house. Was it really that miserable? I think hard about it, and it couldn't have
been that bad right? I missed my parents and brother for the first two weeks. I
wasn't alone because i had my girlfriend, but I felt lonely. It was like I lost
them even though they were only half an hour away. Rather, it was like I lost
that piece of my life forever, and the only thing left to do is to look forward.

I've been back to my parent's house. I don't quite feel like a stranger, but I
also don't feel like I belong. I stand in my room and think about the _me_ that
used to inhabit this place. The _me_ that spent the last 20 or so years growing
up in this place. The _me_ that was so unhappy that I _had_ to leave.

I encourage you to be around those you love. Do what you enjoy. Do something
that is meaningful to you. But remember, these moments are just moments and
don't last forever. That's what makes memories so beautiful.

## Life is What You Make It

Life is hard. Getting up early for work is hard. Making dinner every night is
hard. Going grocery shopping every weekend at Walmart and Costco is hard.
Finding time for passions like art and music is hard.

Commuting sucks. Paying rent sucks. Going to the gym when you're already tired
sucks.

I could sleep in, call in sick, and work from home. I could order dine outside
or order food delivery. I can put off learning the guitar because "I should
focus on work" or "I don't have enough time". I could skip the gym because "it's
leg day and I need a rest day anyway."

## What's Next?

Anyway, I'm still figuring things out, and I hope that I never stop learning and
striving to be better each day.
