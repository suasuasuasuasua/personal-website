## Repositories

My `Neovim` configuration is currently in two places:
[nvim](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nvim) and
[nixvim](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixvim). Both of these
configurations were heavily inspired by
[kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), a minimal starting
point for Neovim with sensible out-of-the-box configurations and detailed
documentation. The idea is that kickstart will give you the tools to build your
own configuration, rather than providing everything like a distribution would
(see [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for example).

I have mainly been using the nixvim configuration since last year. It is powered
by the [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) project, a Neovim
distribution powered by `nix`. It allows you to define your Neovim
configurations using `nix` modules rather than typical `lua` files. This has the
added advantage of build reproducibility and seamless integration into the rest
of my `nix` system configuration.

Here is a snippet of a few configurations from the [kickstart
configuration](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixvim/blob/4909cbf25ccec926b763fe71629ea3ae912fff55/config/kickstart.nix)
written as a `nix` module.

```nix
{
  # ...
  opts = {
    number = true;
    relativenumber = true;
    mouse = "a";
    showmode = false;
    clipboard = {
      providers = {
        wl-copy.enable = true
      };
      # register = "unnamedplus";
    };
    breakindent = true;
  }
```

To build a use this configuration, it is as simple as including it as a flake
and then adding to my package list.

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    nixvim-config.url = "github:suasuasuasuasua/nixvim";
    # ...
  };
}

# nixvim.nix
{
  inputs,
  config,
  pkgs,
  ...
}:
let
  inherit (pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform) system;
  nixvim = inputs.nixvim-config.packages.${system}.default.extend {
    config.plugins = {
      # ...
    };

    config.nixvim = {
      lsp.languages = {
        # ...
      };
      plugins = {
        custom = {
          # ...
        };
      };
    };
  };
in
{
  home.packages = [
    nixvim # include it here!
  ];
}
```

Then finally we can rebuild the system and get our new Neovim configuration.

```bash
nh os switch .
```

You can find all of the possible nixvim configurations
[here](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/). Currently, the stable branch is
25.05, which I try to stay on as much as possible. Sometimes, plugins will break
so I'll either have to change the `git` revision or switch to the unstable
branch.

## Plugins

Here is a list of my favorite plugins.

- [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp)
  - lightweight completion engine that gives you autocomplete from many sources
  like LSP, terminal, buffer, snippets, etc.
- [grug-far.nvim](https://github.com/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim)
  - search (and replace) engine
- [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
  - pretty customizable statusline
- [neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit)
  - interactive git interface within Neovim

- [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim)
  - Neovim and obsidian integration for notetaking

  - interface for the native neovim treesitter functionality

## Quirks

1. The translation form `lua` to `nix` can be challenging. Most plugins do not
   specify how to configure it using `nix` but with `lua`. However, once you do
use it for long enough, it comes pretty naturally. Moreover, there are some
weird workarounds that you have to deal with if A) a plugin isn't available in
nixpkgs, B) you want to use lazy loading, or C) a module option doesn't exist
yet.
2. My Neovim configuraiton on my MacBook is slower and less consistent than the
   configuration on my Linux systems. I have no idea why this would happen,
especially since my MacBook is much more powerful than my $600 server. I imagine
that it has something to do with the ARM chip or perhaps how macOS is not the
first class citizen for `nix` related things. My regular `nvim` configuration is
_much_ faster.
   - For reference, the startup time will be a difference between 70-100ms which
     isn't _huge_ but I do wonder about that inconsistency
3. Rebuilding the `neovim` after each and every change sometimes tedious and
   time consuming, especially if you love tweaking the configuration here and
there. With a regular setup, all you do is change the `lua` file and keep
rolling
4. To be completely honest, I have spend _too_ much time figuring out how to
   wrangle this framework and would have been more productive just _using_
Neovim with something like [nixCats](https://nixcats.org/), which keeps your
`lua` configuration along with the `nix` build system
