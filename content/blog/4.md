## Repositories

My `Neovim` configuration is currently in two places:
[nvim](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nvim) and
[nixvim](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixvim). Both of these
configurations were heavily inspired by
[kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), a minimal starting
point for Neovim with sensible out-of-the-box configurations and detailed
documentation. The idea is that kickstart will give you the tools to build your
own configuration, rather than providing everything like a distribution would
(see [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for example).

I have mainly been using the nixvim configuration since last year. It is powered
by the [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) project, a Neovim
distribution powered by `nix`. It allows you to define your Neovim
configurations using `nix` modules rather than typical `lua` files. This has the
added advantage of build reproducibility and seamless integration into the rest
of my `nix` system configuration.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't know `nix`, it is like an extended, functional `json`, which is

Here is a snippet of a few configurations from the [kickstart
configuration](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixvim/blob/4909cbf25ccec926b763fe71629ea3ae912fff55/config/kickstart.nix)
written as a `nix` module.

```nix
{
  # ...
  opts = {
    number = true;
    relativenumber = true;
    mouse = "a";
    showmode = false;
    clipboard = {
      providers = {
        wl-copy.enable = true
      };
      # register = "unnamedplus";
    };
    breakindent = true;
  }
```

To build a use this configuration, it is as simple as including it as a flake
and then adding to my package list.

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    nixvim-config.url = "github:suasuasuasuasua/nixvim";
    # ...
  };
}

# nixvim.nix
{
  inputs,
  config,
  pkgs,
  ...
}:
let
  inherit (pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform) system;
  nixvim = inputs.nixvim-config.packages.${system}.default.extend {
    config.plugins = {
      # ...
    };

    config.nixvim = {
      lsp.languages = {
        # ...
      };
      plugins = {
        custom = {
          # ...
        };
      };
    };
  };
in
{
  home.packages = [
    nixvim # include it here!
  ];
}
```

Then finally we can rebuild the system and get our new Neovim configuration.

```bash
nh os switch .
```

You can find all of the possible [nixvim configurations
here](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/). Currently, the stable branch is
25.05, which I try to stay on as much as possible. Sometimes, plugins will break
so I'll either have to change the `git` revision or switch to the unstable
branch.

## Quirks

1. The translation form `lua` to `nix` can be challenging. Most plugins do not
   specify how to configure it using `nix` but with `lua`. However, once you do
   use it for long enough, it comes pretty naturally. Moreover, there are some
   weird workarounds that you have to deal with if A) a plugin isn't available in
   nixpkgs, B) you want to use lazy loading, or C) a module option doesn't exist
   yet.
1. My Neovim configuration on my MacBook is slower and less consistent than the
   configuration on my Linux systems. I have no idea why this would happen,
   especially since my MacBook is much more powerful than my $600 server. I
   imagine that it has something to do with the ARM chip or perhaps how macOS is
   not the first class citizen for `nix` related things. My regular `nvim`
   configuration is _much_ faster.
   - For reference, the startup time will be a difference between 70-100ms which
     isn't _huge_ but I do wonder about that inconsistency
1. Rebuilding the `neovim` after each and every change sometimes tedious and
   time consuming, especially if you love tweaking the configuration here and
   there. With a regular setup, all you do is change the `lua` file and keep
   rolling
1. To be completely honest, I have spent _too_ much time figuring out how to
   wrangle this framework and would have been more productive just using Neovim
   as Neovim
   - if I wanted to use `nix`, then something like
     [nixCats](https://nixcats.org/) allows me to keep my `lua` configuration with
     the `nix` build system
   - a package manager like [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/) can easily track
     plugin dependencies, but may not be able to track external dependencies like
     `ripgrep`, `fzf`, etc.
